            <p><i>Interesting Facts about Camels</i></p>
                <li>Camels’ humps are not used to store water. Even though they come from hot climates, their humps store fat and also help the rest of their bodies to stay cooler. When needed, the fat will be converted to food or water.</li>
                <li>The word ‘camel’ comes from an Arabic word, when it’s literally translated, it means beauty. Don’t ever try and say that camels are ugly!</li>
                <li>They need to stay hydrated in the desert, so it’s no surprise that camels can drink as much as 40 gallons of water at once. Considering it’s not being stored in their humps, that’s pretty amazing.</li>
